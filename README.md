# Discord-bots

A collection of discord bots that I do for fun.

Dicebot: Users can use '!r' to roll a dice and have the bot return an answer. Example: '!r 2d20' to roll a d20 die twice, you can roll as many times as you want and as big of a die as you want

Countbot: A simple game for discord, where players input numbers in chronological order starting at 0. Players cannot input a number twice in a row and must alternate. The game is over when the number inputted is not the next number in chronological order and the game resets back to 0.

Rolebot: Created to assign new users to a specific role for a server instead of being grouped into 'online'.
