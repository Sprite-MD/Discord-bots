# Discord-bots

UPDATE: Discord.py, the library these bots use to connect to the API, has been discontinued. I don't have any current plans to update the code to make it compatible with future versions of Discord. Therefore, these bots will become outdated as of April 2022. 


A collection of discord bots that I do for fun.

**Dicebot**: Users can use '!r' to roll a dice and have the bot return an answer. Example: '!r 2d20' to roll a d20 die twice, you can roll as many times as you want and as big of a die as you want

**Countbot**: A simple game for discord, where players input numbers in chronological order starting at 0. Players cannot input a number twice in a row and must alternate. The game is over when the number inputted is not the next number in chronological order and the game resets back to 0.

**Rolebot**: Created to assign new users to a specific role for a server instead of being grouped into 'online'.
